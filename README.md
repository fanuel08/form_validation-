## Registration Form

A simple and user-friendly registration form with basic input validation and password toggle functionality.
Features:

    Name Validation: Minimum 3 characters.

    Email Validation: Checks for a valid email format.

    Password Validation: Minimum 8 characters with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.

    Password Confirmation: Ensures passwords match.

    Terms & Conditions: Requires agreement before submission.

    Password Toggle: Allows users to show/hide their password.

    Clear Form: Button to reset the form and messages.

Files:

    index.html: HTML structure of the form.

    styles.css: Styling for the form.

    script.js: JavaScript for form validation and functionality.

How It Works:

    Form Submission: When the user submits the form, it validates the inputs. If any validation fails, error messages are shown. If successful, the data is saved in localStorage, and a success message appears.

    Password Toggle: Click "Show" to reveal the password; it changes to "Hide" when visible.

    Clear Form: Click "Clear Form" to reset inputs and messages.
